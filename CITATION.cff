title: 'gms: ''GAMS'' Modularization Support Package'
version: 0.31.4
date-released: '2024-07-18'
abstract: A collection of tools to create, use and maintain modularized model code
  written in the modeling language 'GAMS' (<https://www.gams.com/>). Out-of-the-box
  'GAMS' does not come with support for modularized model code. This package provides
  the tools necessary to convert a standard 'GAMS' model to a modularized one by introducing
  a modularized code structure together with a naming convention which emulates local
  environments. In addition, this package provides tools to monitor the compliance
  of the model code with modular coding guidelines.
